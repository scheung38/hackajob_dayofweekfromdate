Question

Wouldn't it be neat if every year, your birthday would fall on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday? Well we cannot create a program for that (yet) but we can find out the exact years this will happen.
Given a certain date, return a string with the day of the week and the year it will fall in a weekend, starting with the current year (2016). Do this for 50 years in the future.

INPUT
string
date_of_birth (with this format: dd-mm)

OUTPUT
string
wday-yyyy wday-yyyy ... (where wday can be any of this three values: Fry, Sat, Sun)
Every date should be sepparated by one space


EXAMPLE
Input
"23-10"

Output
"Sun-2016 Fri-2020 Sat-2021 Sun-2022 Fri-2026 Sat-2027 Sat-2032 Sun-2033 Fri-2037 Sat-2038 Sun-2039 Fri-2043 Sun-2044 Fri-2048 Sat-2049 Sun-2050 Fri-2054 Sat-2055 Sat-2060 Sun-2061 Fri-2065"
